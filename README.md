## **Developer mindset:**
> The purpose of the software is not to show off how intelligent you are. — Max Kanat-Alexander.

> Code Simplicity : Every programmer is a designer.

> The developer design of software aims to make developers job as easy as possible so they can focus on what matters.

> You will create software that will help users and your software will continue to help them for a long time. 

> Actually, one of the best ways to improve your design skills is to be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with.

> Understanding is the key difference between a bad developer and a good developer "Max Kanat-Alexander".

> A “good developer” is doing everything in their power to make the code as simple as possible for other programmers.

>  It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation. 'Max Kanat-Alexander'. 

> Code that isn’t consistent becomes harder to understand. Don’t keep forcing developers to relearn the way your system works every time they look at a new piece of it.
